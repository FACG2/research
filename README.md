## Attacks

### Man In The Middle (MITM)

A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyberattack where a malicious actor inserts him/herself into a conversation between two parties, impersonates both parties and gains access to information that the two parties were trying to send to each other. A man-in-the-middle attack allows a malicious actor to intercept, send and receive data meant for someone else, or not meant to be sent at all, without either outside party knowing until it is too late.

#### How to prevent MITM:

  * Look for the “green glow” in the address bar: Man in the middle in the wild today can be combated through Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates and to notice when there is an absence of green. EV SSL Certificates definitively confirm the identity of the organization that owns the Web site. Online criminals do not have access to EV SSL Certificates for the sites they’re counterfeiting and therefore cannot spoof the green glow that shows that an authenticated Web site is secure.

  * Download the latest version of high security Web browsers.
